    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I’m a Graphic Designer living in Melbourne, Australia. I became interested in Front-End Web Design and Development because I wanted to build well-designed websites. Plus I like code.</p>

    <h2>My Mission</h2>
    <p>As I learn more about front-end, I hope to one day work as a Graphic Designer and Web Developer with an NGO or small start up or be freelancing, because I like to work in a place that I believe in.</p>

    <p>This is how I’ve evolved professionally:</p>

      <li><strong>Graphic Designer,</strong> Melbourne Guru <br><em>Melbourne, 2014 </em></li>

      <li><strong>Graphic Designer,</strong> Committee for Sri Lanka <br><em>Melbourne, 2014</em></li>
    </ul>
